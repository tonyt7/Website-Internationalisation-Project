# Website-Internationalisation-Project
A multilingual website prototype built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**. The site detects the user's browser language and automatically redirects them to a localized version of the homepage with a smooth progress bar animation. The theme used for demonstration is **Kerala Culture**, but the structure is fully adaptable to any internationalised content.
